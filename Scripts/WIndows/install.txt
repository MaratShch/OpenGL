Run the Script (with Execution Policy): By default, Windows restricts running PowerShell scripts for security reasons. You have a few options:

Option 1 (Recommended - Most Secure): Run the script with an execution policy that allows it to run this one time:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install_opengl.ps1
Use code with caution.
Powershell

Explanation:
==============
powershell: Starts a new PowerShell instance.

-ExecutionPolicy Bypass: Temporarily bypasses the execution policy restriction for this command only. This is safer than changing the global execution policy.

-File .\install_opengl.ps1: Specifies the path to your script file. The .\ means "the current directory".
